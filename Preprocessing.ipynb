       " 'Pursuant to the provisions of Section of the Securities Exchange Act of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc FINRA is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rule change to adopt FINRA Rule Restricted Firm Obligations to require member firms that are identified as Restricted Firms to maintain deposit in segregated account from which withdrawals would be restricted adhere to specified conditions or restrictions or comply with combination of such obligations and adopt new FINRA Rule Procedures for Regulating Activities Under Rule and amend FINRA Rule Hearing Procedures for Expedited Proceedings Under the Rule Series to create new expedited proceeding to implement proposed Rule In addition FINRA proposes to adopt Capital Acquisition Broker CAB Rule Restricted Firm Obligations to clarify that member firms that have elected to be treated as CABs would be subject to proposed FINRA Rule and to amend Funding Portal Rule Application of FINRA Rule Series Code of Procedure to Funding Portals to clarify that funding portals would not be subject to proposed FINRA Rule FINRA is proposing to adopt Rule new rule that would use numeric thresholds based on firm level and individual level disclosure events and impose Restricted Deposit Requirement on member firms that present high degree of risk to the investing public Proposed Rule would require member designated as Restricted Firm to establish Restricted Deposit Account and maintain in that account deposits of cash or qualified securities with an aggregate value that is not less than the member Restricted Deposit Requirement except in certain identified situations and be subject to conditions or restrictions on the member operations as determined by the Department to be necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and in the public interest The multi step process would begin with an annual calculation Proposed Rule would require the Department to calculate annually the Preliminary Identification Metrics to determine whether member firm meets the Preliminary Criteria for Identification For each member firm that meets the Preliminary Criteria for Identification the Department would conduct pursuant to proposed Rule an initial internal evaluation to determine whether the member firm does not warrant further review under Rule In doing so the Department would review whether it has information to conclude that the computation of the member firm Preliminary Identification Metrics included disclosure events or other conditions that should not have been included because they are not consistent with the purpose of the Preliminary Criteria for Identification and are not reflective of firm posing high degree of risk If the Department determines after its initial evaluation that member firm warrants further review under proposed Rule such member firm if it would be meeting the Preliminary Criteria for Identification for the first time would have onetime opportunity to reduce its staffing levels to no longer meet the criteria within business days after being informed by the Department For members that warrant further review after being deemed to meet the Preliminary Criteria for Identification and after the initial Department evaluation the Department would then determine the member maximum Restricted Deposit Requirement If the Department determines that member firm warrants further Rule review the Department would consult with the member firm pursuant to proposed Rule The Consultation will give the member firm an opportunity to demonstrate why it does not meet the Preliminary Criteria for Identification why it should not be designated as Restricted Firm and why it should not be subject to the maximum Restricted Deposit Requirement In the Consultation there would be two rebuttable presumptions that the member firm should be designated as Restricted Firm and that it should be subject to the maximum Restricted Deposit Requirement The member firm would bear the burden of overcoming those presumptions After the Consultation proposed Rule would require that the Department render Department decision Pursuant to proposed Rule the Department would provide written notice of its decision to the member firm pursuant to proposed Rule and no later than days from the latest scheduling letter provided to the member firm under proposed Rule that states the obligations to be imposed on the member firm if any and the ability of the member firm to request hearing with the Office of Hearing Officers in an expedited proceeding The proposed Restricted Firm Obligations Rule would require FINRA to determine annually whether each member firm is or continues to be Restricted Firm and whether the member firm should be subject to any obligations Thus proposed Rule contains provisions that set forth how any obligations that were imposed during the Rule process in one year are continued or terminated in that same year and in subsequent years If Department decision requires member firm to establish Restricted Deposit Account proposed Rule would govern the account The underlying policy for the proposed account requirements is that to make deposit requirement effective in creating appropriate incentives to member firms that pose higher risks to change their behavior the member firm must be restricted from withdrawing any of the required deposit amount even if it terminates its FINRA membership Proposed Rule would establish new requirements to maintain books and records that evidence the member firm compliance with the Restricted Firm Obligations Rule and any Restricted Deposit Requirement or other conditions or restrictions imposed under that rule FINRA also is proposing requirement to address the situation when member firm fails to comply with the obligations imposed pursuant to proposed Rule Under proposed Rule FINRA would be authorized to issue notice pursuant to proposed Rule directing member firm that is not in compliance with its Restricted Deposit Requirement or with any conditions or restrictions imposed under Rule to suspend all or portion of its business complete list of defined terms used in proposed Rule appears in proposed Rule FINRA plans to conduct review of proposed Rule after gaining sufficient experience under proposed Rule FINRA is proposing to establish new expedited proceeding in proposed Rule that would allow member firms to request prompt review of the Department determinations under the Restricted Firm Obligations Rule and grant right to challenge any of the Rule Requirements including any Restricted Deposit Requirements imposed Proposed Rule would establish an expedited proceeding for the Department determinations under proposed Rule to designate member firm as Restricted Firm and impose obligations on the member and to deny member request to access all or part of its Restricted Deposit Requirement Proposed Rule would establish an expedited proceeding to address member firm failure to comply with any requirements imposed pursuant to proposed Rule Proposed Rule would authorize the Department after receiving authorization from FINRA chief executive officer or such other executive officer as the CEO may designate to serve notice stating that the member firm failure to comply with the Rule Requirements within seven days of service of the notice will result in suspension or cancellation of membership The proposed rule also would provide that if member firm does not request hearing the suspension or cancellation will become effective seven days after service of the notice Proposed Rule also would provide that member firm could file request seeking termination of suspension imposed pursuant to the rule on the

Agencies are proposing changes to the Framework that would update clarify and simplify the descriptions but would not make any substantive revisions to how the Clearing Agencies manage their liquidity

the supplemental liquidity deposits or SLD Under Rule of the NSCC Rules Procedures Members whose default would pose the largest liquidity exposure to NSCC are required to make additional deposits to

       " 'Pursuant to Section of the Securities Exchange Act of Act and Rule notice is given that on March Cboe Exchange Inc the Exchange or Cboe Options filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Commission the proposed rule change to amend Rule Series of Option Contracts Open for Trading in connection with limiting the number of strikes listed for Short Term Option Series which are available for quoting and trading on the Exchange Specifically this proposal seeks to widen the intervals between strikes in order to limit the number of strikes listed for multiply listed equity options classes excluding options on Exchange Traded Funds ETFs and Exchange Traded Notes ETNs within the Short Term Option Series program that have an expiration date more than days from the listing date The proposal is intended to remove repetitive and unnecessary strike listings across the weekly expiries Specifically the proposal seeks to reduce the number of strikes listed in the furthest weeklies which generally have wider markets and therefore lower market quality The proposed strike intervals are intended to widen permissible strike intervals in multiply listed equity options excluding options on ETFs and ETNs where there is less volume as measured by the Average Daily Volume tiers Therefore the lower the Average Daily Volume the greater the proposed spread between strike intervals Options classes with higher volume contain the most liquid symbols and strikes which the Exchange believes makes the finer proposed spread between strike intervals for those symbols appropriate Additionally lower priced shares have finer strike intervals than higher priced shares when comparing the proposed spread between strike intervals Today weeklies are available on of underlying products The proposal limits the density of strikes listed in series of options without reducing the classes of options available for trading on the Exchange Short Term Option Series with an expiration date greater than days from the listing date currently equate to of the total number of strikes in the options market which equals strikes The Exchange expects this proposal to result in the limitation of approximately strikes within the Short Term Option Series which is approximately of the total strikes in the options markets The proposal takes into account customer demand for certain options classes by considering both the Share Price and the Average Daily Volume in order to remove certain strike intervals where there exist clusters of strikes whose characteristics closely resemble one another and therefore do not serve different trading needs rendering these strikes less useful The Exchange also notes that the proposal focuses on strikes in multiply listed equity options and excludes ETFs and ETNs as the majority of strikes reside within equity options As proposed the Exchange is permitted to list options on newly eligible listings without having to apply the wider strike intervals until the end of the first full calendar quarter after such options were listed The proposal thereby permits the Exchange to add strikes to meet customer demand in newly listed options class newly eligible option class may fluctuate in price after its initial listing such volatility reflects natural uncertainty about the security By deferring the application of the proposed wider strike intervals until after the end of the first full calendar quarter additional information on the underlying security will be available to market participants and public investors as the price of the underlying has an opportunity to settle based on the price discovery that has occurred in the primary market during this deferment period Also the Exchange has the ability to list as many strikes as are permissible for the Short Term Option Series once the expiry is no more than days Short Term Option Series that have an expiration date no more than days from the listing date are not subject to the proposed strike intervals which allows the Exchange to list additional and potentially narrower strikes in the event of market volatility or other market events These metrics are intended to align expectations for determining which strike intervals will be utilized Finally proposed Rule D provides that notwithstanding the strike intervals imposed in proposed subparagraph the proposal does not amend the range of strikes that may be listed pursuant to subparagraph While the current listing rules permit the Exchange to list number of weekly strikes on its market in an effort to encourage Market Makers to deploy capital more efficiently as well as improve displayed market quality the proposal aims to reduce the density of strikes listed in later weeks by widening the intervals between strikes listed for equity options excluding options on ETFs and ETNs which have an expiration date more than days from the listing date The Exchange requires Designated Primary Market Makers DPMs Lead Market Makers LMMs and Market Makers to quote during certain amount of time in the trading day and in certain percentage of series in their assigned options classes to maintain liquidity in the market With an increasing number of strikes being listed across options exchanges Market Makers must expend their capital to ensure that they have the appropriate infrastructure to meet their quoting obligations on all options markets in which they are assigned in option classes The Exchange believes that by widening the intervals between strikes listed for equity options excluding options on ETFs and ETNs thus reducing the number of strikes listed on the Exchange the proposal will likewise reduce the number of weekly strikes in which DPMs LMMs and Market Makers are required to quote and as result allow DPMs LMMs and Market Makers to expend their capital in the options market in more efficient manner Due to this increased efficiency the Exchange believes that the proposal may improve overall market quality on the Exchange by widening the intervals between strikes in multiply listed equity options excluding options on ETFs and ETNs that have an expiration date more than days from the listing date The proposal is intended to balance the goal of limiting the number of listed strikes with the needs of market participants The Exchange believes that the various permissible strike intervals will continue to offer market participants the ability to select the appropriate strikes to meet their investment objectives The Commission is publishing the notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons All submissions should refer to File Number SR CBOE and should be submitted on or before April ',\n",

       " 'Overview On April the New Jersey Supreme Court issued an unfavorable ruling in Hager MandK Construction holding that an employer must reimburse workers compensation claimant for the costs of purchasing medical marijuana Details The New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision holding that workers compensation insurers do not fit within the mandatory reimbursement exception in New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act MMA applicable to private health insurers and government medical assistance programs ii medical marijuana may be found to constitute reasonable and necessary care under the Workers Compensation Act which includes chronic pain as qualifying medical condition iii the MMA is not preempted by the federal Controlled Substances Act CSA which is effectively suspended with respect to this issue and iv Employer does not face credible threat of federal criminal aiding and abetting or conspiracy liability Plaintiff suffered significant lower back injury while working on construction site and he underwent laminectomy and lumbar fusion during the several intervening years before his workers compensation claim was tried After being prescribed several different types of opioids to deal with chronic pain that neither these procedures nor those prescriptions appeared to alleviate Plaintiff was approved for the MMA and experienced reduction in pain and was able to stop taking Oxycodone due to medical marijuana regimen The workers compensation trial judge found Plaintiff back injury to be work related and ordered Employer to reimburse him for the cost of medical marijuana and any related expenses Since the medical experts agreed that either opioids or marijuana were the only two treatment options to alleviate Plaintiff pain the trial judge compared these therapies based on the expert testimony and determined that while Both modalities present significant downsides in terms of adverse consequences and risksa comparison leads inescapably to conclusion that marijuana is the appropriate option The trial judge cited the significant adverse consequences caused by opioids including the risk of death and its significantly more physically addictive nature On appeal Employer argued that the CSA which makes it crime to manufacture possess or distribute marijuana preempts the MMA because it is impossible to comply with both statutes and that the reimbursement order violates the CSA because it requires Employer to aid and abet Plaintiff possession of an illegal substance Employer also asserted that it should be treated similarly to private health insurer which is not required under the MMA to cover the costs of medical marijuana and that the trial judge erred in failing to consider whether medical marijuana is reasonable and necessary form of treatment under the Workers Compensation Act The New Jersey Court of Appeals affirmed the trial judge decision finding Plaintiff use of medical marijuana reasonable and necessary because he has demonstrated the severity and chronic nature of his pain his attempts to unsuccessfully alleviate the pain with multiple surgeries and medical modalities and the validated efficacy of the prescribed medical marijuana The Court of Appeals held there is no legislative or legal barrier to an employers reimbursement of its employees expense for medical marijuana in workers compensation setting finding that there is no conflict between the CSA and MMA because the reimbursement order does not require Employer to possess manufacture or distribute marijuana but only to reimburse Plaintiff for his purchase of medical marijuana The Court of Appeals also found that Employer compliance with the order does not establish the specific intent element of an aiding and abetting offense under federal law and that workers compensation insurers should not be treated as private health insurers under the MMA and therefore are not entitled to that law exception from reimbursing the costs of medical marijuana On appeal the New Jersey Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts that exempting workers compensation insurance carriers from responsibility for injured workers medical marijuana costs would be antithetical to the Legislature express findings in the Compassionate Use Act and the traditional broad liberal application of New Jerseys workers compensation scheme The Supreme Court also cited approvingly the trial court conclusion that marijuana was the clearly indicated option when compared with opioids the only other treatment option available and that marijuana enabled Plaintiff to conquer his addiction to opioids and avoid what the trial court concluded was likely path of worsening addiction and ultimately death In holding that the MMA was not preempted by the CSA the Supreme Court cited guidance from the S Department of Justice DOJ in recent years that has at times deprioritized but not prohibited federal prosecution of marijuana activities that are legal under state law The Supreme Court noted that Congress has also deprioritized prosecution for possession of medical marijuana by prohibiting the DOJ from using allocated funds to prevent states including New Jersey from implementing their medical marijuana laws As result the Supreme Court concluded that it is possible for Employer to abide by both the CSA and the MMA and that the CSA as applied to the MMA and the order at issue in this case is effectively suspended by the most recent appropriations rider for at least the duration of the federal fiscal year Contacts Kenneth Stoller Senior Director Workers Compensation and Amicus Counsel ken stoller apci org Colleen Shiel Vice President Deputy General Counsel colleen shiel apci org',\n",

its initial evaluation that member firm warrants further review under proposed Rule such member firm if it would be meeting the Preliminary Criteria for Identification for the first time would have onetime opportunity to reduce its staffing levels to no longer meet the criteria within business days after being informed by the Department For members that warrant further review after being deemed to meet the Preliminary Criteria for Identification and after the initial Department evaluation the Department would then determine the member maximum Restricted Deposit Requirement If the Department determines that member firm warrants further Rule review the Department would consult with the member firm pursuant to proposed Rule The Consultation will give the member firm an opportunity to demonstrate why it does not meet the Preliminary Criteria for Identification why it should not be designated as Restricted Firm and why it should not be subject to the maximum Restricted Deposit Requirement In the Consultation there would be two rebuttable presumptions that the member firm should be designated as Restricted Firm and that it should be subject to the maximum Restricted Deposit Requirement The member firm would bear the burden of overcoming those presumptions After the Consultation proposed Rule would require that the Department render Department decision Pursuant to proposed Rule the Department would provide written notice of its decision to the member firm pursuant to proposed Rule and no later than days from the latest scheduling letter provided to the member firm under proposed Rule that states the obligations to be imposed on the member firm if any and the ability of the member firm to request hearing with the Office of Hearing Officers in an expedited proceeding The proposed Restricted Firm Obligations Rule would require FINRA to determine annually whether each member firm is or continues to be Restricted Firm and whether the member firm should be subject to any obligations Thus proposed Rule contains provisions that set forth how any obligations that were imposed during the Rule process in one year are continued or terminated in that same year and in subsequent years If Department decision requires member firm to establish Restricted Deposit Account proposed Rule would govern the account The underlying policy for the proposed account requirements is that to make deposit requirement effective in creating appropriate incentives to member firms that pose higher risks to change their behavior the member firm must be restricted from withdrawing any of the required deposit amount even if it terminates its FINRA membership Proposed Rule would establish new requirements to maintain books and records that evidence the member firm compliance with the Restricted Firm Obligations Rule and any Restricted Deposit Requirement or other conditions or restrictions imposed under that rule FINRA also is proposing requirement to address the situation when member firm fails to comply with the obligations imposed pursuant to proposed Rule Under proposed Rule FINRA would be authorized to issue notice pursuant to proposed Rule directing member firm that is not in compliance with its Restricted Deposit Requirement or with any conditions or restrictions imposed under Rule to suspend all or portion of its business complete list of defined terms used in proposed Rule appears in proposed Rule FINRA plans to conduct review of proposed Rule after gaining sufficient experience under proposed Rule FINRA is proposing to establish new expedited proceeding in proposed Rule that would allow member firms to request prompt review of the Department determinations under the Restricted Firm Obligations Rule and grant right to challenge any of the Rule Requirements including any Restricted Deposit Requirements imposed Proposed Rule would establish an expedited proceeding for the Department determinations under proposed Rule to designate member firm as Restricted Firm and impose obligations on the member and to deny member request to access all or part of its Restricted Deposit Requirement Proposed Rule would establish an expedited proceeding to address member firm failure to comply with any requirements imposed pursuant to proposed Rule Proposed Rule would authorize the Department after receiving authorization from FINRA chief executive officer or such other executive officer as the CEO may designate to serve notice stating that the member firm failure to comply with the Rule Requirements within seven days of service of the notice will result in suspension or cancellation of membership The proposed rule also would provide that if member firm does not request hearing the suspension or cancellation will become effective seven days after service of the notice Proposed Rule also would provide that member firm could file request seeking termination of suspension imposed pursuant to the rule on the ground of full compliance with the notice or decision If member firm requests hearing under proposed Rule the hearing would be subject to Rule FINRA is proposing several amendments to Rule that would be specific to hearings requested pursuant to proposed Rule ',\n",

       " 'Pursuant to Section of the Securities Exchange Act of the Act and Rule thereunder notice is given that on March Cboe Exchange Inc the Exchange or Cboe Options filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the Commission the proposed rule change to adopt Rule to provide Market Makers with an additional voluntary compression tool that will permit them to more efficiently compress their index option portfolios in order to reduce the required capital attributable to their portfolios while maintaining their risk exposure The Exchange understands that regulatory capital requirements have impeded liquidity providers market makers in particular ability to provide liquidity to the market In response the Exchange has made certain tools available that Trading Permit Holders TPHs can use to compress the notional size of their portfolios to reduce the capital attributable to those portfolios Pursuant to Rule the Exchange may make compression orders available to TPHs which orders enable TPHs after submitting compression position lists to the Exchange to execute orders in P Index SPX options without exposure to reduce the aggregate capital attributable to those positions subject to certain requirements Additionally pursuant to Rule TPHs may transfer positions in exchange listed options off the Exchange if the transfer does not result in change in ownership and reduces the risk weighted assets RWA associated with those positions The Exchange believes compression continues to be an important tool to enable Market Makers to efficiently manage the size of their portfolios and the amount of capital that must be maintained by their Clearing TPHs CTPHs in connection with those portfolios As result the Exchange regularly reviews its compression tools and evaluates potential enhancements to those tools The Exchange believes that permitting TPHs to execute offsetting SPX options positions without exposure using compression orders and to effect off floor RWA transfers of exchange listed options has had beneficial effect on the bank regulatory capital requirements of CTPHs parent companies without adversely affecting the quality of the options market The Exchange has determined that combination of elements of those two tools would increase the efficiency of compression for Market Makers Specifically the Exchange proposes notwithstanding Rule the Exchange may make available to Market Makers multilateral compression service for certain index options identified by the Exchange pursuant to which Market Maker may close or open positions in options listed on the Exchange to reduce regulatory capital attributable to its portfolio The proposed process regarding the submission of position lists is similar to the current process for submitting compression position lists in connection with the submission of compression orders Currently prior to submitting compression orders TPHs must submit lists of open SPX options positions they would like to close using compression orders while TPHs may open positions using compression orders but do not need to include those positions on compression position lists submitted in advance to the Exchange The proposed compression service will similarly require Market Makers to submit lists of open option positions they would like to close and also require them to submit option positions they would like to open using the compression service The Exchange believes requiring inclusion of any positions to be opened in addition to closed in the positions list submitted to the compression service as well as capital attributable to those positions will provide the Exchange with additional information when determining whether the compression participants are using the compression service to reduce regulatory capital attributable to their positions Therefore the Exchange believes the proposed requirements for use of the compression service particularly the requirement to include the amount of capital associated with each position and the requirement that the positions must in the aggregate reduce attributable regulatory capital similar to compression orders are net position closing or neutral are reasonable as they will create additional controls to limit use of the compression service to legitimate compression purposes The Exchange believes the proposed compression service will provide Market Makers with an additional tool to reduce regulatory capital attributable to their portfolios in accordance with their businesses and risk management practices The Exchange understands from customers and Market Makers in particular there continues to be significant need to reduce regulatory capital attributable to their open interest based on then current market conditions The need for compression is particularly true during times of extreme volatility such as the recent historic levels of market volatility which can make providing liquidity in index options immensely more challenging when market participants need liquidity the most The Exchange believes the ability of Market Makers to compress their portfolios helps reduce the risk of market dislocation especially during periods of increased volume and volatility as they can continue providing liquidity during such times which may increase the regulatory capital attributed to their portfolios because they will know that they can subsequently reduce their open positions and concomitant regulatory capital Because some CTPHs carrying those are bank owned broker dealers those CTPHs are subject to further bank regulatory capital requirements which result in those additional punitive capital requirements being passed on to their market maker clients The Exchange believes implementation of SA CCR by all CTPHs will not eliminate the need for Market Makers to engage in the compression of their portfolios Market Makers regularly avail themselves of compression orders in which they use the information provided in the Exchange provided position lists to identify potential counterparties that similarly need to close index option open interest Additionally certain TPHs avail themselves of off floor RWA transfers across their own accounts to similarly achieve the purpose The proposed compression transactions will be able to occur in numerous options as part of multilateral transactions effected at single time which will permit Market Makers to compress their portfolios more efficiently than they can using current compression tools The proposed compression service streamlines current compression tools which the Exchange believes will permit Market Makers to reduce more efficiently any potential negative impact on the market making community that has resulted from bank regulatory capital requirements The Exchange expects the proposed compression service will provide Market Makers with an additional avenue to free up much needed capital which will benefit the entire market and all investors The Commission is publishing the notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons ',\n",

quality living environment where architectural solutions combine tradition with the modern technology The European Commission designed the New European Bauhaus initiative to pursue the goals of the European Green Deal through culture cultural heritage creativity research and technical innovations The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said that the New European Bauhaus is the soul of the European Green Deal in her State of the Union address in September Recommendations and incentives from the approved conclusions should encourage member states to implement the proposed qualitative criteria into spatial planning to follow the principles of circular economy and to improve access to information and financial instruments supporting future projects connected to the living environment The minister emphasised that the goal was to make culture high quality architecture and built environment which are key elements of the New European Bauhaus the basis of all interministerial policies in the field of living environment Approving the conclusions on European audiovisual and media content the minister expressed his concern as the European audiovisual and media sector is still suffering the consequences of the COVID pandemic He explained that significantly lower revenues in cinemas have led to reduced funding for original European productions This he said has brought about competition between providers for dominant position in the on demand audiovisual services market with significant differences between providers The aim of the approved conclusions is to encourage the member states and the European Commission to adopt measures in their jurisdiction to provide the audiovisual and media sector with competitive advantage on the European and international market and enable sustainable development The proposed measures emphasise solutions which would increase the visibility and availability of the European audiovisual and media content on the digital market while innovation creativity and cultural and linguistic diversity are the key to improving European audiovisual and media contents competitiveness and also its main strength The ministers also held policy debate with Mr Simoniti chairing an exchange of views on the strategic importance of heritage rights for the future of Europe and global sustainable development At the invitation of Minister Simoniti the Secretary General of Europa Nostra Sneska Quaedvlieg Mihailovic also participated in the debate During the discussion the participants also expressed their concern over the situation of culture heritage and artists especially female artists in Afghanistan To conclude Mr Simoniti emphasised that asylum and migration policies do not fall within the jurisdiction of the European Union nor within that of culture ministers but as culture ministers we have the moral right to call for reflection on how we can contribute to the humane treatment of the most at risk groups of artists from this country The least we can do is make sure that the voices of these artists are heard At the end of the session ministers took note of the initiatives for the recovery of the cultural sector following the COVID pandemic and listened to presentation of priorities of the upcoming French presidency of the Council of the EU The European Commission held presentation on establishment of single point for financing cultural sectors in the period Minister Simoniti thanked his colleagues for the constructive debate and their cooperation in drawing up the final draft

reporting requirements set forth in Sections ii and of the CAT NMS Plan The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend the Rule Series to be consistent with the Allocation Exemption Pursuant to Section ii of the CAT NMS Plan each Participant must through its Compliance Rule require its Industry Members to record and report to the Central Repository if the order is executed in whole or in part an Allocation Report the SRO Assigned Market Participant Identifier of the clearing broker or prime broker if applicable and the CAT Order ID of any contra side order On August the Participants submitted to the Commission request for an exemption from certain allocation reporting requirements set forth in Sections ii and of the CAT NMS Plan In the Exemption Request the Participants requested that they be permitted to implement the Allocation Alternative which is an alternative approach to reporting allocations to the Central Repository To implement the Allocation Alternative the Participants requested exemptive relief from Section ii of the CAT NMS Plan to the extent that the provision requires each Participant to through its Compliance Rule require its Industry Members that are executing brokers who do not perform Allocations to record and report to the Central Repository if the order is executed in whole or in part an Allocation Report Under the Allocation Alternative when an Industry Member other than an executing broker g prime broker or clearing broker performs an Allocation that Industry Member would be required to submit the Allocation Report to the Central Repository When an executing broker performs an Allocation for an order that is executed in whole or in part the burden of submitting an Allocation Report to the Central Repository would remain with the executing broker under the Allocation Alternative Currently the definition of Allocation Report in the CAT NMS Plan only refers to shares To implement the Allocation Alternative the Participants proposed to require that all required elements of Allocation Reports apply to both shares and contracts as applicable for all Eligible Securities Furthermore to implement the Allocation Alternative the Participants proposed to require the information on all Allocation Reports Allocation ID which is the internal allocation identifier assigned to the allocation event by the Industry Member trade date settlement date IB correspondent CRD Number FDID of new order allocation instruction time if the account meets the definition of institution under FINRA Rule type of allocation for DVP

granted the exemptive relief requested in the Exemption Request The Commission granted the relief conditioned upon the adoption of Compliance Rules that implement the reporting requirements of the Allocation Alternative Accordingly the Exchange proposes certain changes to its Compliance Rule to implement the reporting requirements of the Allocation Alternative The Exchange proposes to add definition of Allocation as new paragraph to Rule Proposed paragraph of Rule would define an Allocation to mean the placement of shares contracts into the same account for which an order was originally placed or the placement of shares contracts into an account based on allocation instructions The Exchange proposes to amend the definition of Allocation Report set forth in Exchange Rule to reflect the requirements of the Allocation Exemption The Exchange proposes to amend the definition in two ways applying the requirements for Allocation Reports to contracts in addition to shares and requiring the reporting of additional elements for the Allocation Report The requirements for Allocation Reports apply only to shares as the definition of Allocation Report in Rule refers to shares not contracts The Exchange proposes to amend Rule to apply to contracts as well as shares The Commission also conditioned the Allocation Exemption on the Participants amending their Compliance Rules to require the ten additional elements in Allocation Reports Accordingly the Exchange proposes to require the additional elements in Allocation Reports The Commission granted the Participants an exemption from the requirement that the Participants through their Compliance Rule require executing brokers that do not perform Allocations to submit Allocation Reports Accordingly the Exchange proposes to eliminate Rule A which requires an Industry Member to record and report to the Central Repository an Allocation Report if the order is executed in whole or in part and to replace the provision with proposed Rule F The Allocation Exemption requires the Participants to amend their Compliance Rules to require Industry Members to provide Allocation Reports to the Central Repository any time they perform Allocations to client account whether or not the Industry Member was the executing broker for the trades In accordance with the Allocation Exemption the Exchange proposes to add proposed Rule F to the Compliance Rule In the Allocation Exemption the Commission also exempted the Participants from the requirement that they amend their Compliance Rules to require Industry Members to report Allocations for accounts other than client accounts To clarify that an Industry Member must report an Allocation Report solely for Allocations to client account proposed Rule F specifically

restricted adhere to specified conditions or restrictions or comply with combination of such obligations and adopt new FINRA Rule Procedures for Regulating Activities Under Rule and amend FINRA Rule Hearing Procedures for Expedited Proceedings Under the Rule Series to create new expedited proceeding to implement proposed Rule In addition FINRA proposes to adopt Capital Acquisition Broker CAB Rule Restricted Firm Obligations to clarify that member firms that have elected to be treated as CABs would be subject to proposed FINRA Rule and to amend Funding Portal Rule Application of FINRA Rule Series Code of Procedure to Funding Portals to clarify that funding portals would not be subject to proposed FINRA Rule FINRA is proposing to adopt Rule new rule that would use numeric thresholds based on firm level and individual level disclosure events and impose Restricted Deposit Requirement on member firms that present high degree of risk to the investing public Proposed Rule would require member designated as Restricted Firm to establish Restricted Deposit Account and maintain in that account deposits of cash or qualified securities with an aggregate value that is not less than the member Restricted Deposit Requirement except in certain identified situations and be subject to conditions or restrictions on the member operations as determined by the Department to be necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and in the public interest The multi step process would begin with an annual calculation Proposed Rule would require the Department to calculate annually the Preliminary Identification Metrics to determine whether member firm meets the Preliminary Criteria for Identification For each member firm that meets the Preliminary Criteria for Identification the Department would conduct pursuant to proposed Rule an initial internal evaluation to determine whether the member firm does not warrant further review under Rule In doing so the Department would review whether it has information to conclude that the computation of the member firm Preliminary Identification Metrics included disclosure events or other conditions that should not have been included because they are not consistent with the purpose of the Preliminary Criteria for Identification and are not reflective of firm posing high degree of risk If the Department determines after its initial evaluation that member firm warrants further review under proposed Rule such member firm if it would be meeting the Preliminary Criteria for Identification for the first time would have onetime opportunity to reduce its staffing levels to no longer meet the criteria within business days after being informed by the Department For members that warrant further review after being deemed to meet the Preliminary Criteria for Identification and after the initial Department evaluation the Department would then determine the member maximum Restricted Deposit Requirement If the Department determines that member firm warrants further Rule review the Department would consult with the member firm pursuant to proposed Rule The Consultation will give the member firm an opportunity to demonstrate why it does not meet the Preliminary Criteria for Identification why it should not be designated as Restricted Firm and why it should not be subject to the maximum Restricted Deposit Requirement In the Consultation there would be two rebuttable presumptions that the member firm should be designated as Restricted Firm and that it should be subject to the maximum Restricted Deposit Requirement The member firm would bear the burden of overcoming those presumptions After the Consultation proposed Rule would require that the Department render Department decision Pursuant to proposed Rule the Department would provide written notice of its decision to the member firm pursuant to proposed Rule and no later than days from the latest scheduling letter provided to the member firm under proposed Rule that states the obligations to be imposed on the member firm if any and the ability of the member firm to request hearing with the Office of Hearing Officers in an expedited proceeding The proposed Restricted Firm Obligations Rule would require FINRA to determine annually whether each member firm is or continues to be Restricted Firm and whether the member firm should be subject to any obligations Thus proposed Rule contains provisions that set forth how any obligations that were imposed during the Rule process in one year are continued or terminated in that same year and in subsequent years If Department decision requires member firm to establish Restricted Deposit Account proposed Rule would govern the account The underlying policy for the proposed account requirements is that to make deposit requirement effective in creating appropriate incentives to member firms that pose higher risks to change their behavior the member firm must be restricted from withdrawing any of the required deposit amount even if it terminates its FINRA membership Proposed Rule would establish new requirements to maintain books and records that evidence the member firm compliance with the Restricted Firm Obligations Rule and any Restricted Deposit Requirement or other conditions or restrictions imposed under that rule FINRA also is proposing requirement to address the situation when member firm fails to comply with the obligations imposed pursuant to proposed Rule Under proposed Rule FINRA would be authorized to issue notice pursuant to proposed Rule directing member firm that is not in compliance with its Restricted Deposit Requirement or with any conditions or restrictions imposed under Rule to suspend all or portion of its business complete list of defined terms used in proposed Rule appears in proposed Rule FINRA plans to conduct review of proposed Rule after gaining sufficient experience under proposed Rule FINRA is proposing to establish new expedited proceeding in proposed Rule that would allow member firms to request prompt review of the Department determinations under the Restricted Firm Obligations Rule and grant right to challenge any of the Rule Requirements including any Restricted Deposit Requirements imposed Proposed Rule would establish an expedited proceeding for the Department determinations under proposed Rule to designate member firm as Restricted Firm and impose obligations on the member and to deny member request to access all or part of its Restricted Deposit Requirement Proposed Rule would establish an expedited proceeding to address member firm failure to comply with any requirements imposed pursuant to proposed Rule Proposed Rule would authorize the Department after receiving authorization from FINRA chief executive officer or such other executive officer as the CEO may designate to serve notice stating that the member firm failure to comply with the Rule Requirements within seven days of service of the notice will result in suspension or cancellation of membership The proposed rule also would provide that if member firm does not request hearing the suspension or cancellation will become effective seven days after service of the notice Proposed Rule also would provide that member firm could file request seeking termination of suspension imposed pursuant to the rule on the ground of full compliance with the notice or decision If member firm requests hearing under proposed Rule the hearing would be subject to Rule FINRA is proposing several amendments to Rule that would be specific to hearings requested pursuant to proposed Rule ',\n",

       " 'Pursuant to Section of the Securities Exchange Act of and Rule notice is given that on December The Depository Trust Company Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and National Securities Clearing Corporation filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the proposed rule changes of amendments to the Clearing Agency Operational Risk Management Framework of Clearing Agencies Specifically the proposed rule changes would include description of the Clearing Agencies incident management procedures update the ORM Framework to reflect recent changes to group names and responsibilities and other processes and matters described in the Framework and enhance the descriptions of certain matters within the ORM Framework to improve its clarity and comprehensiveness The Clearing Agencies adopted the ORM Framework to provide an outline for how each of the Clearing Agencies manages its operational risks In connection with the annual review and approval of the Framework by the Boards of Directors of each of the Clearing Agencies the Clearing Agencies are proposing to make certain revisions to the Framework First the proposed changes would add description of the Clearing Agencies incident management procedures in Section of the Framework which currently describes information technology management The Clearing Agencies currently follow the incident management procedures which support the Clearing Agencies compliance with the requirements of Rule Ad i and ii and define the actions that are taken following detection of systems incidents The proposed change would be to include description of the existing procedures in the Framework in connection with its description of information technology management Second the proposed changes would update the ORM Framework to reflect recent developments with respect to the names and responsibilities of groups that take certain actions described in the Framework The proposed changes would also reflect updates to processes and other matters described in the Framework Section of the ORM Framework describes the Clearing Agencies management of business continuity risk and the business continuity plans that have been established and maintained by the Clearing Agencies in compliance with the requirements of Rule Ad iii The group responsible for the activities was previously called Business Continuity Management While the role and responsibilities of the risk management function have not changed its name has been changed to Business Continuity Resiliency to reflect an increased focus on strengthening the resiliency of the Clearing Agencies and the ability of their systems to sustain and recover from numerous incidents The Framework would be updated to reflect the change to the name of the group Section of the ORM Framework describes Risk Tolerance Statements which document the overall risk reduction or mitigation objectives for the Clearing Agencies with respect to identified risks to the Clearing Agencies The name of the repository where all policies procedures and related documents are maintained has changed Thus the Clearing Agencies are proposing to update the Section of the Framework to refer generally to the central repository for all policies procedures and related documents rather than refer to the specific name of that central repository The proposed change would allow the Framework to accurately describe where Risk Tolerance Statements are maintained notwithstanding the recent and any potential future change to the name of that document management tool Section of the ORM Framework which describes business continuity risk management currently includes statement that the operating centers that support the Clearing Agencies are run from no fewer than three geographic regions in the United States Since the ORM Framework was adopted the Clearing Agencies have expanded the geographic spread and diversity of their operating centers In order to reflect the change the ORM Framework would be updated to state that the operating centers are run from geographic regions globally Finally the proposed changes would enhance the descriptions of certain matters within the ORM Framework to improve its clarity and comprehensiveness Section of the ORM Framework addresses the Framework ownership and change management The Clearing Agencies are proposing to amend Section of the Framework to include the requirement that the Framework be approved by the Boards or duly authorized committee of the Boards annually Section of the ORM Framework describes the Risk Profiles which are tools used by the Operational Risk Management group within the Group Chief Risk Office of The Depository Trust Clearing Corporation to document risk assessments and consolidate pertinent operational risk and control data including without limitation incidents audit findings compliance testing results and risk metrics to support an overall assessment of the applicable Clearing Agency Business or Clearing Agency Support Area inherent risk and residual risk The Clearing Agencies are proposing changes to the Section to clarify and simplify the description of Risk Profiles First the proposed changes would clarify that the assessments documented in Risk Profiles both assess inherent risks and identify residual risks Second the proposed change would simplify the description of how the Risk Profiles are created by removing reference to ORM as the responsible group Third the proposed changes would clarify that Clearing Agency businesses and support areas are responsible for the day to day management of all risk applicable to their area Finally the proposed changes would clarify that the Clearing Agency businesses and support areas are responsible for updating their policies and procedures to support risk management at the Clearing Agencies ',\n",

or Latinx Asian Native American or Alaska Native Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander two or more races or ethnicities or as LGBTQ or to explain why the company does not have at least two directors on its board who self identify in the categories listed above ii to adopt Rule Board Diversity Disclosure which would require Nasdaq listed companies subject to certain exceptions to provide statistical information in proposed uniform format on the company board of directors related to director self identified gender race and self identification as LGBTQ and iii to update Rule and IM Foreign Private Issuers and Rule Types of Deficiencies and Notifications to incorporate references to proposed Rule and Rule and iv to make certain other non substantive conforming changes Nasdaq conducted an internal study of the current state of board diversity among Nasdaq listed companies based on public disclosures and found that while some companies already have made laudable progress in diversifying their boardrooms the national market system and the public interest would best be served by an additional regulatory impetus for companies to embrace meaningful and multi dimensional diversification of their boards Accordingly Nasdaq is proposing to require each of its listed companies subject to certain exceptions to provide statistical information regarding diversity among the members of the company board of directors under proposed Rule and ii have or explain why it does not have at least two Diverse directors on its board under proposed rule Under proposed Rule Nasdaq proposes to provide each company with one calendar year from the date that the Commission approves the proposal the Approval Date to comply with the requirement for statistical information regarding diversity Nasdaq undertook extensive research and analysis and has concluded that the proposal will fulfill the objectives of the Act in that it is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of free and open market and national market system to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest While gender diversity has improved among S company boards in recent years the pace of change has been gradual and the S still lags behind other jurisdictions that have imposed requirements related to board diversity Moreover progress toward bringing underrepresented racial and ethnic groups into the boardroom has been even slower Exchange also considered the experience of its parent company Nasdaq Inc as public company As self regulatory organization Nasdaq also is cognizant of its role in advancing diversity within the financial industry as outlined in the Commission diversity standards issued pursuant to Section of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of Standards With the objectives in mind Nasdaq believes that listing rule designed to enhance transparency related to board diversity will increase consistency and comparability of information across Nasdaq listed companies increasing transparency and decreasing information collection costs Nasdaq surveys of investors and reviews of their disclosed policies and actions show that board diversity is priority when assessing companies and investors report in some cases relying on intuition when there is lack of empirical evidenced based data Nasdaq believes it is well within the Exchange delegated regulatory authority to propose listing rules designed to enhance transparency so long as they do not conflict with existing federal securities laws Nasdaq proposes to improve transparency regarding board diversity by requiring all listed companies to publicly disclose unbundled consistent data utilizing uniform transparent framework on their website or in their proxy statement under Rule Similarly Nasdaq proposes to promote accountability in corporate decision making by requiring companies who do not have at least two Diverse directors on their board to provide investors with public explanation of the board reasons for not doing so under Rule Nasdaq is also proposing new Rule which would require each company to provide the disclosure required under Rule in either the company proxy statement or information statement for its annual meeting for shareholders or on the company website Nasdaq is proposing to adopt new Rule to require each listed company to have or explain why it does not have at least two members of its board of directors who are Diverse including at least one who self identifies as Female and one who self identifies as an Underrepresented Minority or LGBTQ Proposed Rule provides transition period before companies must fully satisfy the requirement to have two Diverse directors or explain why they do not upon the initial implementation of the rule Nasdaq proposes to adopt Rule and new Rule F to specify what happens if company does not have at least two Diverse directors as set forth

listed companies subject to certain exceptions to have at least one director who self identifies as female and to have at least one director who self identifies as Black or African American Hispanic or Latinx Asian Native American or Alaska Native Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander two or more races or ethnicities or as LGBTQ or to explain why the company does not have at least two directors on its board who self identify in the categories listed above ii to adopt Rule Board Diversity Disclosure which would require Nasdaq listed companies subject to certain exceptions to provide statistical information in proposed uniform format on the company board of directors related to director self identified gender race and self identification as LGBTQ and iii to update Rule and IM Foreign Private Issuers and Rule Types of Deficiencies and Notifications to incorporate references to proposed Rule and Rule and iv to make certain other non substantive conforming changes Nasdaq conducted an internal study of the current state of board diversity among Nasdaq listed companies based on public disclosures and found that while some companies already have made laudable progress in diversifying their boardrooms the national market system and the public interest would best be served by an additional regulatory impetus for companies to embrace meaningful and multi dimensional diversification of their boards Accordingly Nasdaq is proposing to require each of its listed companies subject to certain exceptions to provide statistical information regarding diversity among the members of the company board of directors under proposed Rule and ii have or explain why it does not have at least two Diverse directors on its board under proposed rule Under proposed Rule Nasdaq proposes to provide each company with one calendar year from the date that the Commission approves the proposal the Approval Date to comply with the requirement for statistical information regarding diversity Nasdaq undertook extensive research and analysis and has concluded that the proposal will fulfill the objectives of the Act in that it is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of free and open market and national market system to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest While gender diversity has improved among S company boards in recent years the pace of change has been gradual and the S still lags behind other jurisdictions that have imposed requirements related to board diversity Moreover progress toward bringing underrepresented racial and ethnic groups into the boardroom has been even slower Exchange also considered the experience of its parent company Nasdaq Inc as public company As self regulatory organization Nasdaq also is cognizant of its role in advancing diversity within the financial industry as outlined in the Commission diversity standards issued pursuant to Section of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of Standards With the objectives in mind Nasdaq believes that listing rule designed to enhance transparency related to board diversity will increase consistency and comparability of information across Nasdaq listed companies increasing transparency and decreasing information collection costs Nasdaq surveys of investors and reviews of their disclosed policies and actions show that board diversity is priority when assessing companies and investors report in some cases relying on intuition when there is lack of empirical evidenced based data Nasdaq believes it is well within the Exchange delegated regulatory authority to propose listing rules designed to enhance transparency so long as they do not conflict with existing federal securities laws Nasdaq proposes to improve transparency regarding board diversity by requiring all listed companies to publicly disclose unbundled consistent data utilizing uniform transparent framework on their website or in their proxy statement under Rule Similarly Nasdaq proposes to promote accountability in corporate decision making by requiring companies who do not have at least two Diverse directors on their board to provide investors with public explanation of the board reasons for not doing so under Rule Nasdaq is also proposing new Rule which would require each company to provide the disclosure required under Rule in either the company proxy statement or information statement for its annual meeting for shareholders or on the company website Nasdaq is proposing to adopt new Rule to require each listed company to have or explain why it does not have at least two members of its board of directors who are Diverse including at least one who self identifies as Female and one who self identifies as an Underrepresented Minority or LGBTQ Proposed Rule provides transition period before companies must fully satisfy the requirement to have two Diverse directors or explain why they do not upon the initial implementation of the rule Nasdaq proposes to adopt Rule and new Rule F to specify what happens if company does not have at least two Diverse directors as set forth under Rule and fails to provide the disclosure required by Rule Nasdaq believes such disclosure would help inform the evolving body of research on the relationship between broader diverse attributes

listed companies subject to certain exceptions to have at least one director who self identifies as female and to have at least one director who self identifies as Black or African American Hispanic or Latinx Asian Native American or Alaska Native Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander two or more races or ethnicities or as LGBTQ or to explain why the company does not have at least two directors on its board who self identify in the categories listed above ii to adopt Rule Board Diversity Disclosure which would require Nasdaq listed companies subject to certain exceptions to provide statistical information in proposed uniform format on the company board of directors related to director self identified gender race and self identification as LGBTQ and iii to update Rule and IM Foreign Private Issuers and Rule Types of Deficiencies and Notifications to incorporate references to proposed Rule and Rule and iv to make certain other non substantive conforming changes Nasdaq conducted an internal study of the current state of board diversity among Nasdaq listed companies based on public disclosures and found that while some companies already have made laudable progress in diversifying their boardrooms the national market system and the public interest would best be served by an additional regulatory impetus for companies to embrace meaningful and multi dimensional diversification of their boards Accordingly Nasdaq is proposing to require each of its listed companies subject to certain exceptions to provide statistical information regarding diversity among the members of the company board of directors under proposed Rule and ii have or explain why it does not have at least two Diverse directors on its board under proposed rule Under proposed Rule Nasdaq proposes to provide each company with one calendar year from the date that the Commission approves the proposal the Approval Date to comply with the requirement for statistical information regarding diversity Nasdaq undertook extensive research and analysis and has concluded that the proposal will fulfill the objectives of the Act in that it is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of free and open market and national market system to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest While gender diversity has improved among S company boards in recent years the pace of change has been gradual and the S still lags behind other jurisdictions that have imposed requirements related to board diversity Moreover progress toward bringing underrepresented racial and ethnic groups into the boardroom has been even slower Exchange also considered the experience of its parent company Nasdaq Inc as public company As self regulatory organization Nasdaq also is cognizant of its role in advancing diversity within the financial industry as outlined in the Commission diversity standards issued pursuant to Section of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of Standards With the objectives in mind Nasdaq believes that listing rule designed to enhance transparency related to board diversity will increase consistency and comparability of information across Nasdaq listed companies increasing transparency and decreasing information collection costs Nasdaq surveys of investors and reviews of their disclosed policies and actions show that board diversity is priority when assessing companies and investors report in some cases relying on intuition when there is lack of empirical evidenced based data Nasdaq believes it is well within the Exchange delegated regulatory authority to propose listing rules designed to enhance transparency so long as they do not conflict with existing federal securities laws Nasdaq proposes to improve transparency regarding board diversity by requiring all listed companies to publicly disclose unbundled consistent data utilizing uniform transparent framework on their website or in their proxy statement under Rule Similarly Nasdaq proposes to promote accountability in corporate decision making by requiring companies who do not have at least two Diverse directors on their board to provide investors with public explanation of the board reasons for not doing so under Rule Nasdaq is also proposing new Rule which would require each company to provide the disclosure required under Rule in either the company proxy statement or information statement for its annual meeting for shareholders or on the company website Nasdaq is proposing to adopt new Rule to require each listed company to have or explain why it does not have at least two members of its board of directors who are Diverse including at least one who self identifies as Female and one who self identifies as an Underrepresented Minority or LGBTQ Proposed Rule provides transition period before companies must fully satisfy the requirement to have two Diverse directors or explain why they do not upon the initial implementation of the rule Nasdaq proposes to adopt Rule and new Rule F to specify what happens if company does not have at least two Diverse directors as set forth under Rule and fails to provide the disclosure required by Rule Nasdaq believes such disclosure would help inform the evolving body of research on the relationship between broader diverse attributes company performance and investor protection and provide investors with additional information about the company philosophy regarding broader diversity characteristics The Commission is publishing the

restricted adhere to specified conditions or restrictions or comply with combination of such obligations and adopt new FINRA Rule Procedures for Regulating Activities Under Rule and amend FINRA Rule Hearing Procedures for Expedited Proceedings Under the Rule Series to create new expedited proceeding to implement proposed Rule In addition FINRA proposes to adopt Capital Acquisition Broker CAB Rule Restricted Firm Obligations to clarify that member firms that have elected to be treated as CABs would be subject to proposed FINRA Rule and to amend Funding Portal Rule Application of FINRA Rule Series Code of Procedure to Funding Portals to clarify that funding portals would not be subject to proposed FINRA Rule FINRA is proposing to adopt Rule new rule that would use numeric thresholds based on firm level and individual level disclosure events and impose Restricted Deposit Requirement on member firms that present high degree of risk to the investing public Proposed Rule would require member designated as Restricted Firm to establish Restricted Deposit Account and maintain in that account deposits of cash or qualified securities with an aggregate value that is not less than the member Restricted Deposit Requirement except in certain identified situations and be subject to conditions or restrictions on the member operations as determined by the Department to be necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and in the public interest The multi step process would begin with an annual calculation Proposed Rule would require the Department to calculate annually the Preliminary Identification Metrics to determine whether member firm meets the Preliminary Criteria for Identification For each member firm that meets the Preliminary Criteria for Identification the Department would conduct pursuant to proposed Rule an initial internal evaluation to determine whether the member firm does not warrant further review under Rule In doing so the Department would review whether it has information to conclude that the computation of the member firm Preliminary Identification Metrics included disclosure events or other conditions that should not have been included because they are not consistent with the purpose of the Preliminary Criteria for Identification and are not reflective of firm posing high degree of risk If the Department determines after its initial evaluation that member firm warrants further review under proposed Rule such member firm if it would be meeting the Preliminary Criteria for Identification for the first time would have onetime opportunity to reduce its staffing levels to no longer meet the criteria within business days after being informed by the Department For members that warrant further review after being deemed to meet the Preliminary Criteria for Identification and after the initial Department evaluation the Department would then determine the member maximum Restricted Deposit Requirement If the Department determines that member firm warrants further Rule review the Department would consult with the member firm pursuant to proposed Rule The Consultation will give the member firm an opportunity to demonstrate why it does not meet the Preliminary Criteria for Identification why it should not be designated as Restricted Firm and why it should not be subject to the maximum Restricted Deposit Requirement In the Consultation there would be two rebuttable presumptions that the member firm should be designated as Restricted Firm and that it should be subject to the maximum Restricted Deposit Requirement The member firm would bear the burden of overcoming those presumptions After the Consultation proposed Rule would require that the Department render Department decision Pursuant to proposed Rule the Department would provide written notice of its decision to the member firm pursuant to proposed Rule and no later than days from the latest scheduling letter provided to the member firm under proposed Rule that states the obligations to be imposed on the member firm if any and the ability of the member firm to request hearing with the Office of Hearing Officers in an expedited proceeding The proposed Restricted Firm Obligations Rule would require FINRA to determine annually whether each member firm is or continues to be Restricted Firm and whether the member firm should be subject to any obligations Thus proposed Rule contains provisions that set forth how any obligations that were imposed during the Rule process in one year are continued or terminated in that same year and in subsequent years If Department decision requires member firm to establish Restricted Deposit Account proposed Rule would govern the account The underlying policy for the proposed account requirements is that to make deposit requirement effective in creating appropriate incentives to member firms that pose higher risks to change their behavior the member firm must be restricted from withdrawing any of the required deposit amount even if it terminates its FINRA membership Proposed Rule would establish new requirements to maintain books and records that evidence the member firm compliance with the Restricted Firm Obligations Rule and any Restricted Deposit Requirement or other conditions or restrictions imposed under that rule FINRA also is proposing requirement to address the situation when member firm fails to comply with the obligations imposed pursuant to proposed Rule Under proposed Rule FINRA would be authorized to issue notice pursuant to proposed Rule directing member firm that is not in compliance with its Restricted Deposit Requirement or with any conditions or restrictions imposed under Rule to suspend all or portion of its business complete list of defined terms used in proposed Rule appears in proposed Rule FINRA plans to conduct review of proposed Rule after gaining sufficient experience under proposed Rule FINRA is proposing to establish new expedited proceeding in proposed Rule that would allow member firms to request prompt review of the Department determinations under the Restricted Firm Obligations Rule and grant right to challenge any of the Rule Requirements including any Restricted Deposit Requirements imposed Proposed Rule would establish an expedited proceeding for the Department determinations under proposed Rule to designate member firm as Restricted Firm and impose obligations on the member and to deny member request to access all or part of its Restricted Deposit Requirement Proposed Rule would establish an expedited proceeding to address member firm failure to comply with any requirements imposed pursuant to proposed Rule Proposed Rule would authorize the Department after receiving authorization from FINRA chief executive officer or such other executive officer as the CEO may designate to serve notice stating that the member firm failure to comply with the Rule Requirements within seven days of service of the notice will result in suspension or cancellation of membership The proposed rule also would provide that if member firm does not request hearing the suspension or cancellation will become effective seven days after service of the notice Proposed Rule also would provide that member firm could file request seeking termination of suspension imposed pursuant to the rule on the ground of full compliance with the notice or decision If member firm requests hearing under proposed Rule the hearing would be subject to Rule FINRA is proposing several amendments to Rule that would

       " 'Pursuant to Section of the Securities Exchange Act of the Act and Rule thereunder notice is given that on March Cboe Exchange Inc the Exchange or Cboe Options filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the Commission the proposed rule change to adopt Rule to provide Market Makers with an additional voluntary compression tool that will permit them to more efficiently compress their index option portfolios in order to reduce the required capital attributable to their portfolios while maintaining their risk exposure The Exchange understands that regulatory capital requirements have impeded liquidity providers market makers in particular ability to provide liquidity to the market In response the Exchange has made certain tools available that Trading Permit Holders TPHs can use to compress the notional size of their portfolios to reduce the capital attributable to those portfolios Pursuant to Rule the Exchange may make compression orders available to TPHs which orders enable TPHs after submitting compression position lists to the Exchange to execute orders in P Index SPX options without exposure to reduce the aggregate capital attributable to those positions subject to certain requirements Additionally pursuant to Rule TPHs may transfer positions in exchange listed options off the Exchange if the transfer does not result in change in ownership and reduces the risk weighted assets RWA associated with those positions The Exchange believes compression continues to be an important tool to enable Market Makers to efficiently manage the size of their portfolios and the amount of capital that must be maintained by their Clearing TPHs CTPHs in connection with those portfolios As result the Exchange regularly reviews its compression tools and evaluates potential enhancements to those tools The Exchange believes that permitting TPHs to execute offsetting SPX options positions without exposure using compression orders and to effect off floor RWA transfers of exchange listed options has had beneficial effect on the bank regulatory capital requirements of CTPHs parent companies without adversely affecting the quality of the options market The Exchange has determined that combination of elements of those two tools would increase the efficiency of compression for Market Makers Specifically the Exchange proposes notwithstanding Rule the Exchange may make available to Market Makers multilateral compression service for certain index options identified by the Exchange pursuant to which Market Maker may close or open positions in options listed on the Exchange to reduce regulatory capital attributable to its portfolio The proposed process regarding the submission of position lists is similar to the current process for submitting compression position lists in connection with the submission of compression orders Currently prior to submitting compression orders TPHs must submit lists of open SPX options positions they would like to close using compression orders while TPHs may open positions using compression orders but do not need to include those positions on compression position lists submitted in advance to the Exchange The proposed compression service will similarly require Market Makers to submit lists of open option positions they would like to close and also require them to submit option positions they would like to open using the compression service The Exchange believes requiring inclusion of any positions to be opened in addition to closed in the positions list submitted to the compression service as well as capital attributable to those positions will provide the Exchange with additional information when determining whether the compression participants are using the compression service to reduce regulatory capital attributable to their positions Therefore the Exchange believes the proposed requirements for use of the compression service particularly the requirement to include the amount of capital associated with each position and the requirement that the positions must in the aggregate reduce attributable regulatory capital similar to compression orders are net position closing or neutral are reasonable as they will create additional controls to limit use of the compression service to legitimate compression purposes The Exchange believes the proposed compression service will provide Market Makers with an additional tool to reduce regulatory capital attributable to their portfolios in accordance with their businesses and risk management practices The Exchange understands from customers and Market Makers in particular there continues to be significant need to reduce regulatory capital attributable to their open interest based on then current market conditions The need for compression is particularly true during times of extreme volatility such as the recent historic levels of market volatility which can make providing liquidity in index options immensely more challenging when market participants need liquidity the most The Exchange believes the ability of Market Makers to compress their portfolios helps reduce the risk of market dislocation especially during periods of increased volume and volatility as they can continue providing liquidity during such times which may increase the regulatory capital attributed to their portfolios because they will know that they can subsequently reduce their open positions and concomitant regulatory capital Because some CTPHs carrying those are bank owned broker dealers those CTPHs are subject to further bank regulatory capital requirements which result in those additional punitive capital requirements being passed on to their market maker clients The Exchange believes implementation of SA CCR by all CTPHs will not eliminate the need for Market Makers to engage in the compression of their portfolios Market Makers regularly avail themselves of compression orders in which they use the information provided in the Exchange provided position lists to identify potential counterparties that similarly need to close index option open interest Additionally certain TPHs avail themselves of off floor RWA transfers across their own accounts to similarly achieve the purpose The proposed compression transactions will be able to occur in numerous options as part of multilateral transactions effected at single time which will permit Market Makers to compress their portfolios more efficiently than they can using current compression tools The proposed compression service streamlines current compression tools which the Exchange believes will permit Market Makers to reduce more efficiently any potential negative impact on the market making community that has resulted from bank regulatory capital requirements The Exchange expects the proposed compression service will provide Market Makers with an additional avenue to free up much needed capital which will benefit the entire market and all investors The Commission is publishing the notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons All submissions should be submitted on or before May ',\n",

Specifically the proposed rule changes would include description of the Clearing Agencies incident management procedures update the ORM Framework to reflect recent changes to group names and responsibilities and other processes and matters described in the Framework and enhance the descriptions of certain matters within the ORM Framework to improve its clarity and comprehensiveness The Clearing Agencies adopted the ORM Framework to provide an outline for how each of the Clearing Agencies manages its operational risks In connection with the annual review and approval of the Framework by the Boards of Directors of each of the Clearing Agencies the Clearing Agencies are proposing to make certain revisions to the Framework First the proposed changes would add description of the Clearing Agencies incident management procedures in Section of the Framework which currently describes information technology management The Clearing Agencies currently follow the incident management procedures which support the Clearing Agencies compliance with the requirements of Rule Ad i and ii and define the actions that are taken following detection of systems incidents The proposed change would be to include description of the existing procedures in the Framework in connection with its description of information technology management Second the proposed changes would update the ORM Framework to reflect recent developments with respect to the names and responsibilities of groups that take certain actions described in the Framework The proposed changes would also reflect updates to processes and other matters described in the Framework Section of the ORM Framework describes the Clearing Agencies management of business continuity risk and the business continuity plans that have been established and maintained by the Clearing Agencies in compliance with the requirements of Rule Ad iii The group responsible for the activities was previously called Business Continuity Management While the role and responsibilities of the risk management function have not changed its name has been changed to Business Continuity Resiliency to reflect an increased focus on strengthening the resiliency of the Clearing Agencies and the ability of their systems to sustain and recover from numerous incidents The Framework would be updated to reflect the change to the name of the group Section of the ORM Framework describes Risk Tolerance Statements which document the overall risk reduction or mitigation objectives for the Clearing Agencies with respect to identified risks to the Clearing Agencies The name of the repository where all policies procedures and related documents are maintained has changed Thus the Clearing Agencies are proposing to update the Section of the Framework to refer generally to the central repository for all policies procedures and related documents rather than refer to the specific name of that central repository The proposed change would allow the Framework to accurately describe where Risk Tolerance Statements are maintained notwithstanding the recent and any potential future change to the name of that document management tool Section of the ORM Framework which describes business continuity risk management currently includes statement that the operating centers that support the Clearing Agencies are run from no fewer than three geographic regions in the United States Since the ORM Framework was adopted the Clearing Agencies have expanded the geographic spread and diversity of their operating centers In order to reflect the change the ORM Framework would be updated to state that the operating centers are run from geographic regions globally Finally the proposed changes would enhance the descriptions of certain matters within the ORM Framework to improve its clarity and comprehensiveness Section of the ORM Framework addresses the Framework ownership and change management The Clearing Agencies are proposing to amend Section of the Framework to include the requirement that the Framework be approved by the Boards or duly authorized committee of the Boards annually Section of the ORM Framework describes the Risk Profiles which are tools used by the Operational Risk Management group within the Group Chief Risk Office of The Depository Trust Clearing Corporation to document risk assessments and consolidate pertinent operational risk and control data including without limitation incidents audit findings compliance testing results and risk metrics to support an overall assessment of the applicable Clearing Agency Business or Clearing Agency Support Area inherent risk and residual risk The Clearing Agencies are proposing changes to the Section to clarify and simplify the description of Risk Profiles First the proposed changes would clarify that the assessments documented in Risk Profiles both assess inherent risks and identify residual risks Second the proposed change would simplify the description of how the Risk Profiles are created by removing reference to ORM as the responsible group Third the proposed changes would clarify that Clearing Agency businesses and support areas are

       " 'The Council of the European Union EU published the proposal for Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive EU Directive EC Directive EC and Regulation EU No as regards corporate sustainability reporting The Non Financial Reporting Directive Directive EU the NFRD amending the Accounting Directive was adopted in Companies within the scope of the NFRD had to report in accordance with its provisions for the first time in covering the financial year The NFRD applies to large public interest entities with an average number of employees in excess of and to public interest entities that are parent companies of large group with an average number of employees in excess of on consolidated basis The NFRD exempts subsidiaries from its reporting obligations if their parent company does the reporting for the whole group including the subsidiaries Approximately companies are subject to the reporting requirements of the NFRD The NFRD introduced requirement for companies to report both on how sustainability issues affect their performance position and development the outside in perspective and on their impact on people and the environment the inside out perspective It is often known as double materiality The European Commission committed itself to proposing revision of the Non Financial Reporting Directive in the European Green Deal and its Work Programme The European Green Deal aims to transform the EU into modern resource efficient and competitive economy with no net emissions of greenhouse gases by It will decouple economic growth from resource use and ensure that all EU regions and citizens participate in socially just transition to sustainable economic system It also aims to protect conserve and enhance the EU natural capital and to protect the health and well being of citizens from environment related risks and impacts The revision of the NFRD will contribute to the objective of building an economy that works for people It will strengthen the EU social market economy helping to ensure that it is future ready and that it delivers stability jobs growth and investment These goals are especially important considering the socio economic damage caused by the COVID pandemic and the need for sustainable inclusive and fair recovery In line with the Commission Sustainable Finance Action Plan the EU has taken number of measures to ensure that the financial sector plays significant part in achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal The objective of the proposal is therefore to improve sustainability reporting at the least possible cost in order to better harness the potential of the European single market to contribute to the transition towards fully sustainable and inclusive economic and financial system in accordance with the European Green Deal and the UN Sustainable Development Goals The proposal aims to ensure that there is adequate publicly available information about the risks that sustainability issues present for companies and the impacts of companies themselves on people and the environment ',\n",
